# About the project
Recipe book is an Angular app which let you manage your own recipes, where you can add new recipes, update and read your already existing recipes, delete the unwanted ones.  

# About Me
I love being an interactive student when it comes to taking courses, so while I was taking this Angular course, I coded the course's project on my own and when I get stuck, I get back to the lecture and watch how the instructor have solved the problem that I was facing.

## What I have learned in this course? 
This is an intensive Angular course ( over 30 hours of content ) so I learned a lot about angular, like: 
* Using the Angular CLI development tool 
* Components 
* Directives 
* Components Communication 
* Data Binding 
* DOM Manipulation 
* Dependency Injection 
* Services 
* Routing
* Observables 
* Forms 
* Pipes
* Creating http requests


and the list goes on...

## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory.

## Running unit tests

Run `ng test` to execute the unit tests via [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io).

## Running end-to-end tests

Run `ng e2e` to execute the end-to-end tests via a platform of your choice. To use this command, you need to first add a package that implements end-to-end testing capabilities.
